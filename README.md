### Adding a Meetup

You can submit a new meetup to be added to the meetups list! See our [Contributing Guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

In short:
1. Create a new issue using the "Add Meetup" template
2. Fill in the meetup details
3. A maintainer will review and approve by adding the `approved-meetup` label
4. The meetup will be automatically added via a pull request
